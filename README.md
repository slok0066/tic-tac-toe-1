## Sound Credits

Sound effects in the public/sounds directory are required for the audio features.
You can add your own MP3 files with the following names:
- move-x.mp3
- move-o.mp3
- win.mp3
- draw.mp3
- click.mp3
- notification.mp3

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

3. Download sound files:
```
node download-sounds.js
```

This will download all the sound files needed for the game. You need to run this once to ensure the sound effects and background music work properly.

## How to Play

1. Select a game mode: AI, Friend, Online or Infinity
2. Choose the board size and style in the settings
3. Make your moves on the board
4. First player to get a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins!

In Infinity mode, each player has only 3 symbols. After placing your 3rd symbol, your first placed symbol will be removed on your next turn.

## Troubleshooting

If sounds are not working, make sure you've run the `node download-sounds.js` command to download all sound files.
